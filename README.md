### What is this?

- A toolkit for helping you get your cookie-consent ready and set up.
- A type-safe way to explore the possibilities of designing your own cookie-consent banner.

### What is it _not_?

- Your legal advisor. Using `react-consent` without any further configuration, **does not mean** that you are compliant with your local law.
- A "go-to" solution for activating analytics once cookies are accepted.
- A cookie-manager.

### Packages included

#### `@react-consent/manager`

This is the manager package we are using to build the logical ground of the whole package family. Use the `@react-consent/manager` package to power your React application with the almighty GDPR-compliant cookie consent banner.
